I"ä<p>Jem was our <a href="http://www.wisheltierescue.com/">sheltie</a> who graced our lives from April(ish) 2009 to almost August 2018.

RIP ‚Äúpoundy‚Äù, I wish we would have had more time together, you were such a special little guy!! We will <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mj37_Rqsec4">see you again</a> (<em>Thanks <a href="http://www.ronniebakerbrooks.com/">Ronnie</a> ‚Ä¶ beautiful song</em>).</p>
